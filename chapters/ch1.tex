\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:ch1}

Here is the introduction to the topic.
When chapters are referenced, the graduate school requires that words are used rather than numbers, e.g. ``Chapter One'' should be used instead of ``Chapter 1.''
Use the command \verb|\cref| to reference chapters, for example \verb|\cref{chapter:ch1}|.
The outline is as follows.
\cref{chapter:ch2} is about paragraphs and sections.
\cref{chapter:ch3} discusses footnotes and citations.
\cref{chapter:ch4} presents floats.
\cref{chapter:ch5} talks about lists.
\cref{chapter:ch6} is the conclusion.
